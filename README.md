A beautiful API for working with WordPress the way you always wanted to.

### What is Silk?

Silk is a library designed as a thin layer on top of WordPress, abstracting away the mess of functions into a clean and expressive object-oriented API.  Use as much or little as you want, while maintaining compatibility with everything else that's meant to work with WordPress.
